## Why Worm? üí°

At Worm, we believe in a sustainable and privacy-respecting approach to API testing. We‚Äôve seen tools like Postman and Insomnia that require cloud syncing, but we know developers want **more control** over their data. Worm is built with **privacy** and **offline-first** workflows at the heart of its design, while also offering flexibility to integrate with external services when necessary.

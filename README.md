## Why Another HTTP Client?

Worm is an **open-source**, **offline-first** HTTP client built with **Tauri** for developers who value **privacy** and **local-first** workflows with an incredible developer experience (DX). Designed to keep your data private and under your control, Worm allows you to interact with APIs in the best way possible, with optional support for cloud integrations for additional tools like **vaults** and **observability**. Whether you‚Äôre working solo or within a team, Worm provides a streamlined and powerful API testing experience.

## TOML Syntax

Worm allows making requests using TOML syntax. Below are some examples:

### GET Requests

```toml
[get]
name = "Get User Info"
url = "_.base_url/users/_.user_id"
```

### POST Requests

```toml
[post]
name = "Create User"
url = "_.base_url/users"

[post.json]
content = """
{
    "userId": "jae",
    "email": "email@gmail.com"
}
"""
```

### Request Bodies

```toml
[get.json]
content = """
{
    "userId": "jae",
    "email": "email@gmail.com"
}
"""

[get.form_data]
content = [
    { field = "file", value = "./path/to/file.txt" },
    { field = "user_name", value = "jet" }
]

[get.form_urlencoded]
content = [
    { field = "title", value = "New Post" },
    { field = "content", value = "This is the content of the new post." },
    { field = "tags", value = "example,post" }
]

[get.xml]
content = """
<post>
  <title>New Post</title>
  <content>This is the content of the new post.</content>
  <tags>
    <tag>example</tag>
    <tag>post</tag>
  </tags>
</post>
"""

[get.text]
content = """
This is a request type of body text. Very concise.
"""
```

### Request Scripts

```toml
[get.pre_request]
code = """
console.log("Hello world.");
"""

[get.post_request]
code = """
console.log("Hello world.");
"""
```

### Query Parameters

```toml
[get.query]
id = "emee"
page = 10
limit = 30
```

### Headers

```toml
[get.headers]
Authorization = "_.auth_token"
Accept = "application/json"
```

**Note:** The syntax is experimental and subject to change based on feasibility, DX, and other factors.
